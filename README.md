# ar-dv1-webcontroller

The AOR AR-DV1 (http://aorusa.com/receivers/ar-dv1.html) is a scanning radio receiver that has a USB interface for serial communications. 

This node app is a work in progress to create a web controller that allows the user to control the receiver.

It is assumed that your receiver is at /dev/ttyUSB0 and you are using the
default port speed of 115200.
